# Backtesting Methodology and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for designing and implementing robust backtests using the Live Strategy Backtester. Following these guidelines will help avoid common pitfalls and produce more reliable results.

## Data Preparation

### Historical Data Quality

1. **Data Sources**

   - Use reliable data providers with minimal gaps
   - Verify data quality against multiple sources
   - Document any known issues or anomalies in your data

2. **Survivorship Bias**

   - Include delisted/defunct instruments in historical universes
   - Use point-in-time databases when possible
   - Document any survivorship bias limitations in your data

3. **Look-Ahead Bias**

   - Ensure data is available at the time of simulated decisions
   - Watch for delayed information (e.g., corporate actions)
   - Be particularly careful with fundamental and alternative data

4. **Data Normalization**
   - Account for splits, dividends, and other corporate actions
   - Normalize for different quote/pricing conventions
   - Consider timezone differences in global markets

### Handling Missing Data

1. **Detection**

   - Systematically identify gaps in time series data
   - Check for frozen values or repeated timestamps
   - Validate that trading hours align with market conventions

2. **Interpolation Methods**

   - Use appropriate interpolation for different data types:
     - Linear interpolation for small gaps in liquid markets
     - Previous value carry-forward for categorical data
     - More sophisticated methods for longer gaps

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all data cleaning steps and interpolation methods
   - Keep metrics on data quality and completeness

## Research Design

### Time Period Selection

1. **Training/Testing Split**

   - Minimum 60/40 split for initial model development
   - Consider walk-forward testing for more robust validation
   - Never optimize using your test/validation set

2. **Market Regimes**

   - Include multiple market regimes in training data
   - Ensure test data includes both bull and bear markets
   - Test separately on trending and ranging market conditions

3. **Time Period Adequacy**
   - Use enough data to capture multiple market cycles
   - For daily data, minimum 5-10 years recommended
   - For higher frequency, ensure adequate samples across different times

### Parameter Optimization

1. **Avoiding Overfitting**

   - Limit the number of strategy parameters
   - Use regularization techniques when appropriate
   - Prefer simpler models over complex ones
   - Be wary of strategies that are highly sensitive to parameter changes

2. **Validation Methods**

   - Use walk-forward optimization
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation
   - Test sensitivity to small parameter changes

3. **Parameter Selection**
   - Use economically reasonable parameter ranges
   - Document the rationale for parameter choices
   - Consider adaptation of parameters over time

## Execution Modeling

### Market Impact

1. **Slippage Models**

   - Simple models: Fixed or percentage-based slippage
   - Volume-based models: Impact increases with order size
   - Market microstructure models: Based on order book dynamics

2. **Liquidity Constraints**

   - Set realistic position sizes based on market liquidity
   - Limit order size as percentage of average daily volume
   - Model partial fills for large orders

3. **Market Hours and Conditions**
   - Account for market hours and holiday closures
   - Model special conditions like circuit breakers
   - Consider different liquidity profiles during regular hours vs. extended hours

### Transaction Costs

1. **Commission Structures**

   - Model actual broker commission structures
   - Include exchange fees and taxes
   - Account for tiered pricing based on volume

2. **Bid-Ask Spread**

   - Use realistic bid-ask spreads based on historical data
   - Model time-varying spreads (wider during volatility)
   - Consider different spread profiles for different market caps/liquidity

3. **Hidden Costs**
   - Account for market impact beyond immediate execution
   - Consider opportunity cost of missed trades
   - Model exchange rebates when applicable

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

1. **Fixed Risk Approaches**

   - Percentage of equity per trade
   - Equal volatility contribution
   - Fixed fractional position sizing

2. **Volatility-Based Sizing**

   - Scale position size inversely with volatility
   - Use recent volatility metrics (ATR, standard deviation)
   - Implement volatility targeting at portfolio level

3. **Portfolio Construction**
   - Consider correlations between instruments
   - Balance exposure across sectors/asset classes
   - Implement exposure limits

### Stop Loss and Take Profit

1. **Implementation**

   - Test both with and without stop losses
   - Document assumptions about execution of stops
   - Be realistic about slippage during stop execution

2. **Types of Stops**

   - Fixed percentage stops
   - Volatility-adjusted stops (e.g., ATR-based)
   - Time-based stops

3. **Risk of Ruin**
   - Calculate and limit risk of ruin
   - Implement maximum drawdown controls
   - Consider correlated risk across positions

## Performance Analysis

### Core Metrics

1. **Return Metrics**

   - Total return
   - Annualized return
   - Monthly/yearly breakdown

2. **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**

   - Sharpe ratio (specify risk-free rate used)
   - Sortino ratio
   - Calmar ratio
   - Maximum drawdown

3. **Trading Metrics**
   - Win rate
   - Profit factor
   - Average win/loss
   - Maximum consecutive losses

### Statistical Validation

1. **Robustness Tests**

   - Monte Carlo simulation of trade sequence
   - Parameter sensitivity analysis
   - Bootstrap testing

2. **Statistical Significance**

   - Calculate p-values for strategy returns
   - Correct for multiple hypothesis testing
   - Compare to appropriate benchmarks

3. **Alternative Scenarios**
   - Worst-case scenario analysis
   - Regime change analysis
   - Stress testing

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Psychological Biases

1. **Confirmation Bias**

   - Test both supporting and contradicting hypotheses
   - Challenge your assumptions deliberately
   - Have peers review your methodology

2. **Recency Bias**

   - Don't overweight recent market conditions
   - Ensure testing across different market regimes
   - Consider longer historical periods when available

3. **Optimism Bias**
   - Assume worse execution than expected
   - Add margin of safety to transaction costs
   - Be conservative in parameter selection

### Technical Pitfalls

1. **Data Mining Bias**

   - Correct for multiple testing when trying many strategies
   - Use Bonferroni correction or false discovery rate control
   - Document the total number of strategies/variations tested

2. **Code Implementation Errors**

   - Implement thorough unit tests
   - Validate with simple test cases
   - Compare results with alternative implementations

3. **Performance Attribution**
   - Decompose returns by factor exposures
   - Distinguish alpha from beta
   - Identify sources of outperformance or underperformance

## Documentation Standards

### Strategy Documentation

1. **Hypothesis and Rationale**

   - Document the economic or behavioral basis for the strategy
   - Cite relevant research or literature
   - Explain expected market conditions for outperformance

2. **Testing Methodology**

   - Document data sources and preparation steps
   - Detail testing period and rationale
   - Explain parameter selection process

3. **Results and Interpretation**
   - Present both favorable and unfavorable results
   - Document limitations and potential improvements
   - Suggest appropriate uses and misuses of the strategy

### Version Control

1. **Strategy Versioning**

   - Maintain version history of strategy changes
   - Document parameter changes between versions
   - Track performance differences between versions

2. **Reproducibility**
   - Save all inputs required to reproduce results
   - Document random seeds for any non-deterministic processes
   - Archive the exact code version used for each backtest
