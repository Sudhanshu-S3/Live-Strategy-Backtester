# Risk Management Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the risk management framework for the Live Strategy Backtester. Effective risk management is critical for developing robust trading strategies that can survive various market conditions. The framework provides tools and methodologies to measure, monitor, and mitigate different types of risk.

## Risk Management Hierarchy

The risk management framework is structured in a hierarchical manner:

1. **Position-Level Risk Management**

   - Individual trade sizing
   - Stop-loss placement
   - Take-profit targets

2. **Strategy-Level Risk Management**

   - Strategy exposure limits
   - Volatility-based position sizing
   - Correlation constraints

3. **Portfolio-Level Risk Management**

   - Asset allocation
   - Diversification requirements
   - Total exposure limits

4. **System-Level Risk Management**
   - Circuit breakers
   - Kill switches
   - Failover mechanisms

## Risk Categories

### Market Risk

Market risk refers to the potential for loss due to market movements affecting strategy performance.

#### Volatility Risk

**Definition**: Risk arising from changes in market volatility.

**Measurement Methods**:

- Historical volatility (standard deviation of returns)
- Implied volatility from options markets
- GARCH models for volatility forecasting

**Management Techniques**:

- Volatility scaling of positions
- Regime-based strategy adjustment
- Volatility targeting at portfolio level

**Implementation**:

```cpp
// Example of volatility-based position sizing
double getVolatilityAdjustedSize(const std::string& instrument, double baseSize) {
    // Calculate historical volatility
    auto prices = dataProvider.getHistoricalPrices(instrument,// filepath: c:\Users\91829\Desktop\Project\Live_Strategy_Backtester\doc\financial\risk_management_framework.md
