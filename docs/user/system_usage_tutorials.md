### Tutorial 1: Running Your First Backtest

This tutorial will walk you through setting up and running a simple backtest.

#### Step 1: Set up the environment

```cpp
#include "core/Backtester.h"
#include "data/CSVDataSource.h"
#include "strategy/BasicStrategy.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize backtester
    Backtester tester;

    // Configure logging
    tester.setLogLevel(LogLevel::INFO);

    return 0;
}
```
Step 2: Load market data

// Create data source
auto dataSource = std::make_shared<CSVDataSource>();

// Add data files
dataSource->addFile("BTCUSDT", "data/BTCUSDT-1s-2025-07-13.csv");
dataSource->addFile("ETHUSDT", "data/ETHUSDT-1s-2025-07-13.csv");

// Set data source to backtester
tester.setDataSource(dataSource);

Completing the Documentation Files
I'll complete each of the empty documentation files for the Live Strategy Backtester project:

1. Performance Measurement Documentation
Benchmark Comparison
Strategies can be compared against standard benchmarks:

Market indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.)
Standard asset class benchmarks
Custom user-defined benchmarks
Reporting
Performance reports can be generated in multiple formats:

Interactive HTML
PDF
JSON for further analysis
Performance Questions
Is the backtester suitable for high-frequency strategies?
Yes, the backtester is optimized for high-performance and can process tick-level data efficiently.

How much historical data can the system handle?
The system is designed to handle years of tick-level data for multiple instruments, limited only by available memory and storage.

Can I perform walk-forward testing?
Yes, use the WalkForwardAnalyzer to conduct walk-forward optimization and testing.

Troubleshooting
My backtest is running slowly. How can I improve performance?
See the Troubleshooting guide for optimization tips.

How do I report bugs or request features?
Submit issues through our GitHub repository or contact support at support@livestrategybacktester.com.

Key Components
Each strategy consists of:

Initialization Logic: Setup parameters, indicators, etc.
Market Data Handlers: Process incoming ticks and bars
Signal Generation: Create trade signals based on your logic
Position Management: Manage entries, exits, and sizing
Risk Management: Apply risk controls
Strategy Development Workflow
Define Strategy Concept

Identify market inefficiency or pattern
Formulate hypothesis
Define entry and exit criteria
Implement Strategy

Code the strategy class
Configure parameters
Set up indicators and signals
Backtest

Run historical simulations
Analyze performance metrics
Identify weaknesses
Optimize

Refine parameters
Improve risk management
Address edge cases
Validation

Out-of-sample testing
Walk-forward analysis
Robustness checks
Example Strategy Implementation
Here's a simple moving average crossover strategy:

Common Strategy Patterns
Trend Following
Moving average crossovers
Breakout systems
Channel strategies
Mean Reversion
Oscillator-based strategies
Statistical arbitrage
Overbought/oversold indicators
Event-Driven
News-based trading
Earnings announcements
Economic data releases
Advanced Techniques
Multi-Timeframe Analysis
Incorporate signals from different timeframes:

Machine Learning Integration
Use the ML integration module:

Best Practices
Keep it simple: Start with simple strategies before adding complexity
Robust testing: Test across different market conditions
Avoid overfitting: Validate on out-of-sample data
Risk management: Always include proper risk controls
Documentation: Clearly document strategy logic and parameters
Step 2: Load market data
Step 3: Create and configure your strategy

// Create strategy
auto strategy = std::make_shared<BasicStrategy>();

// Configure strategy parameters
strategy->setParameter("lookbackPeriod", 20);
strategy->setParameter("entryThreshold", 2.0);
strategy->setParameter("exitThreshold", 1.0);

// Add strategy to backtester
tester.setStrategy(strategy);


Step 4: Configure backtesting parameters
