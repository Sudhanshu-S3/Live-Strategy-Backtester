ystem Usage & Strategy Development
This document provides tutorials for using the backtesting system and guidance on strategy development.

1. System Usage Tutorials
Basic Tutorials
Tutorial 1: Running Your First Backtest
This tutorial will walk you through setting up and running a simple backtest.

Step 1: Set up the environment
Start by including the necessary headers and initializing the backtester.

#include "core/Backtester.h"
#include "data/CSVDataSource.h"
#include "strategy/BasicStrategy.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize backtester
    Backtester tester;

    // Configure logging
    tester.setLogLevel(LogLevel::INFO);

Step 2: Load market data
Create a data source and load your historical data files.

    // Create data source
    auto dataSource = std::make_shared<CSVDataSource>();

    // Add data files
    dataSource->addFile("BTCUSDT", "data/BTCUSDT-1s-2025-07-13.csv");
    dataSource->addFile("ETHUSDT", "data/ETHUSDT-1s-2025-07-13.csv");

    // Set data source to backtester
    tester.setDataSource(dataSource);

Step 3: Create and configure your strategy
Instantiate your strategy and set its parameters.

    // Create strategy
    auto strategy = std::make_shared<BasicStrategy>();

    // Configure strategy parameters
    strategy->setParameter("lookbackPeriod", 20);
    strategy->setParameter("entryThreshold", 2.0);
    strategy->setParameter("exitThreshold", 1.0);

    // Add strategy to backtester
    tester.setStrategy(strategy);

Step 4: Configure backtesting parameters
(This section would detail setting parameters like start/end dates, trading fees, initial capital, etc.)

Step 5: Run backtest and analyze results
Execute the backtest and process the output.

    // Run the backtest
    tester.run();

    // Analyze results
    tester.printResults();

    return 0;
}

Tutorial 2: Multi-Asset Strategy

Tutorial 4: Parameter Optimization
Learn how to use built-in tools to optimize strategy parameters and find the best-performing configurations.

Advanced Tutorials
Tutorial 5: Custom Risk Management
Implement advanced risk management rules beyond simple stop-loss/take-profit, such as portfolio-level risk controls.

Tutorial 6: Custom Performance Metrics
Create and use your own performance metrics to evaluate strategies based on specific criteria.

Exercises
Each tutorial includes practical exercises to reinforce concepts:

Modify the basic strategy to include a stop-loss mechanism.

Create a pairs trading strategy using two correlated assets.

Implement a volatility-based position sizing algorithm.

Build a strategy that combines technical indicators with market sentiment data.

Create a custom visualization for strategy performance.

2. Strategy Development Guide
Key Components of a Strategy
Each strategy consists of:

Initialization Logic: Setup parameters, indicators, and initial state.

Market Data Handlers: Process incoming ticks and bars for each instrument.

Signal Generation: Create trade signals based on your logic.

Position Management: Manage entries, exits, and position sizing.

Risk Management: Apply risk controls like stop-losses or exposure limits.

Strategy Development Workflow
Define Strategy Concept:

Identify a market inefficiency or pattern.

Formulate a testable hypothesis.

Define clear entry and exit criteria.

Implement Strategy:

Code the strategy class inheriting from the base strategy.

Configure parameters.

Set up indicators and signal logic.

Backtest:

Run historical simulations across various market conditions.

Analyze performance metrics.

Identify weaknesses and potential failure points.

Optimize:

Refine strategy parameters using optimization tools.

Improve risk management rules.

Address edge cases discovered during backtesting.

Validation:

Perform out-of-sample testing on data the strategy has not seen.

Conduct walk-forward analysis to simulate live trading.

Run robustness checks (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations).

Example Strategy: Moving Average Crossover
Here is a conceptual implementation for a simple moving average crossover strategy:

Logic: Generate a BUY signal when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. Generate a SELL signal on the reverse crossover.

Parameters: Short-term period, long-term period.

Implementation: The strategy would calculate two moving averages from the market data and check their values on each new bar.

Common Strategy Patterns
Trend Following:

Moving average crossovers

Breakout systems

Channel strategies (e.g., Donchian Channels)

Mean Reversion:

Oscillator-based strategies (RSI, Stochastics)

Statistical arbitrage / Pairs trading

Overbought/oversold indicators

Event-Driven:

News-based trading

Earnings announcements

Economic data releases

Advanced Techniques
Multi-Timeframe Analysis: Incorporate signals from different timeframes (e.g., use a weekly trend to filter daily signals).

Machine Learning Integration: Use the ML integration module to build predictive models for signal generation or regime filtering.

Best Practices
Keep it simple: Start with a simple, robust idea before adding complexity.

Robust testing: Test your strategy across different market conditions (bull, bear, sideways).

Avoid overfitting: Be rigorous with out-of-sample and forward-testing validation.

Risk management: Always include proper risk controls. This is critical.

Documentation: Clearly document strategy logic, parameters, and performance expectations.

3. Performance Measurement
Benchmark Comparison
Strategies can be compared against standard benchmarks to evaluate relative performance:

Market indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.)

Standard asset class benchmarks

Custom user-defined benchmarks

Reporting
Performance reports can be generated in multiple formats:

Interactive HTML: For dynamic charts and data exploration.

PDF: For static, shareable reports.

JSON: For exporting data for further analysis in other tools.

4. Troubleshooting & FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions
Is the backtester suitable for high-frequency strategies?
Yes, the backtester is optimized for high-performance and can process tick-level data efficiently.

How much historical data can the system handle?
The system is designed to handle years of tick-level data for multiple instruments, limited only by available system memory (RAM) and storage.

Can I perform walk-forward testing?
Yes, use the WalkForwardAnalyzer module to conduct walk-forward optimization and testing, which provides a more realistic simulation of live trading.

Common Issues
My backtest is running slowly. How can I improve performance?
See the Performance Optimization Guide for tips on writing efficient strategy code, optimizing data access, and configuring the backtester for speed.
