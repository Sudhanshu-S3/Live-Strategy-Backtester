# Backtesting Methodology and Assumptions

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used by the Live Strategy Backtester for simulating trading strategies on historical data, as well as the key assumptions and limitations that should be considered when interpreting backtest results.

## Backtesting Approaches

The backtester supports multiple approaches to backtesting:

### 1. Event-based Backtesting

- **Description**: Processes market events (trades, quotes, etc.) sequentially in chronological order
- **Pros**: More realistic simulation, handles intraday strategies well
- **Cons**: More computationally intensive, requires detailed data
- **Use case**: Intraday strategies, strategies sensitive to exact execution timing

### 2. Vector-based Backtesting

- **Description**: Processes data in bulk using vectorized operations
- **Pros**: Much faster execution, suitable for parameter optimization
- **Cons**: Less realistic, simplifies market mechanics
- **Use case**: Long-term strategies, initial strategy screening, parameter optimization

### 3. Hybrid Backtesting

- **Description**: Uses vector-based processing for non-critical parts and event-based for execution
- **Pros**: Balance of speed and realism
- **Cons**: More complex implementation
- **Use case**: Most general-purpose backtesting

## Simulation Process

1. **Data Loading**: Historical market data is loaded from the specified sources
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, normalized, and aligned to a consistent timeline
3. **Initialization**: Strategy, portfolio, and risk management components are initialized
4. **Simulation**: Events are processed chronologically:
   - Market data events trigger strategy calculations
   - Strategy signals trigger order generation
   - Orders are matched against available liquidity
   - Trades update the portfolio state
5. **Analysis**: Performance metrics are calculated and results are visualized

## Market Simulation Models

### Order Execution Models

1. **Simple Fill Model**

   - Orders are executed at the next available price
   - No slippage or partial fills
   - Suitable for initial testing

2. **Market Impact Model**

   - Models price impact based on order size and liquidity
   - Calculates realistic slippage
   - Suitable for large position strategies

3. **Order Book Simulation**
   - Simulates a full limit order book
   - Provides realistic fills based on available liquidity
   - Suitable for high-frequency strategies

### Transaction Cost Models

1. **Fixed Cost Model**

   - Fixed fee per transaction
   - Percentage fee of transaction value
   - Suitable for most retail trading strategies

2. **Tiered Cost Model**

   - Volume-based fee tiers
   - Rebates for liquidity provision
   - Suitable for institutional strategies

3. **Custom Cost Model**
   - User-defined cost functions
   - Can incorporate financing costs, market impact, etc.
   - Suitable for specialized trading approaches

## Core Assumptions

1. **Data Quality Assumptions**

   - Historical data accurately represents market conditions
   - Data is free from errors, gaps, and biases
   - Data frequency is sufficient for the strategy being tested

2. **Execution Assumptions**

   - Orders can be executed at the simulated prices
   - Sufficient liquidity is available for executions
   - Execution latency is modeled accurately

3. **Market Assumptions**

   - Markets are continuous and liquid
   - Short selling is always possible (unless explicitly restricted)
   - No limit up/down circuit breakers (unless explicitly modeled)

4. **Operational Assumptions**
   - No system failures or connectivity issues
   - Strategy logic executes without delay
   - No manual intervention during execution

## Known Limitations

1. **Survivorship Bias**

   - Backtest data may only include currently existing assets
   - Failed companies or delisted securities may be excluded
   - Mitigation: Use point-in-time databases with full asset universe

2. **Look-ahead Bias**

   - Accidentally using future information in strategy decisions
   - Mitigation: Strict event sequencing, point-in-time data

3. **Overfitting**

   - Optimizing strategy to fit historical data too closely
   - Mitigation: Out-of-sample testing, cross-validation, walk-forward analysis

4. **Market Impact**

   - Backtests may not fully account for how strategy execution affects markets
   - Mitigation: Market impact models, conservative position sizing

5. **Regime Changes**
   - Market regimes change over time, affecting strategy performance
   - Mitigation: Testing across different market regimes, stress testing

## Advanced Simulation Features

1. **Walk-Forward Testing**

   - Periodically retrain/optimize strategy on expanding window of data
   - Test on unseen out-of-sample data
   - More realistic assessment of strategy adaptability

2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**

   - Generate multiple paths of strategy performance
   - Account for randomness in market outcomes
   - Provides range of potential outcomes rather than single path

3. **Stress Testing**

   - Test strategy under extreme market conditions
   - Simulate flash crashes, liquidity crises, etc.
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities

4. **Scenario Analysis**
   - Test strategy performance in specific market scenarios
   - Custom scenarios can model specific concerns or historical events
   - Helps understand strategy behavior in different environments

## Validation Approaches

1. **Out-of-Sample Testing**

   - Reserve portion of data for validation
   - Strategy must perform well on unseen data
   - Critical for assessing true strategy performance

2. **Cross-Validation**

   - Multiple train/test splits to ensure robustness
   - Reduces dependency on specific time periods
   - Helps identify potential overfitting

3. **Paper Trading**

   - Run strategy in real-time without real money
   - Bridge between backtest and live trading
   - Validates execution model and data processing

4. **Forward Testing**
   - Limited live testing with small position sizes
   - Final validation before full deployment
   - Confirms all systems work as expected in live environment

## Interpreting Results

When analyzing backtest results, consider:

1. **Statistical Significance**

   - Is the sample size large enough?
   - Are results statistically significant or due to chance?
   - What is the strategy's Sharpe ratio and t-statistic?

2. **Robustness**

   - Does performance persist across different market regimes?
   - Is performance sensitive to small parameter changes?
   - Does performance degrade with realistic constraints?

3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**

   - How much risk was taken to achieve returns?
   - Are drawdowns within acceptable limits?
   - Is the return distribution favorable (low skew, low kurtosis)?

4. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Can the strategy be implemented in practice?
   - Are trading volumes realistic given market liquidity?
   - Are operational requirements feasible?

## Best Practices

1. Use realistic assumptions about execution, costs, and liquidity
2. Avoid parameter optimization without out-of-sample validation
3. Test across multiple market regimes and asset classes
4. Include transaction costs and market impact in simulations
5. Compare performance to appropriate benchmarks
6. Consider both quantitative metrics and qualitative behavior
7. Be skeptical of exceptional performance - validate thoroughly
