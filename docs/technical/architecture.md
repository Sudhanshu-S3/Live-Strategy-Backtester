# System Architecture

## Overview

The Live Strategy Backtester is built with a modular, component-based architecture that prioritizes performance, extensibility, and separation of concerns. This document outlines the high-level architecture and design patterns used throughout the system.

## Core Components

### 1. Core Engine (`src/core/`)

The core engine manages the backtesting workflow, handles time synchronization, and coordinates between data sources, strategies, and analytics.

Key components:

- `Backtester`: Central class that coordinates the backtesting process
- `Portfolio`: Manages positions, cash balance, and overall portfolio state
- `Performance`: Calculates and tracks performance metrics
- `Optimizer`: Handles parameter optimization for strategies

Design patterns:

- **Mediator**: The Backtester acts as a mediator between system components
- **Observer**: Components subscribe to events they're interested in

### 2. Data Management (`src/data/`)

Handles loading, preprocessing, and serving market data during the simulation.

Key components:

- Data loaders for various file formats (CSV, custom binary format)
- Data normalizers and preprocessors
- Real-time data connectors for live market data

Design patterns:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different data loading strategies for different sources
- **Adapter Pattern**: Adapters for various data formats

### 3. Event System (`src/event/`)

Provides communication between components using an event-driven architecture.

Key components:

- `EventBus`: Central event dispatcher
- `Event`: Base class for all events
- Event handlers and listeners

Design patterns:

- **Observer Pattern**: Components subscribe to relevant events
- **Command Pattern**: Events encapsulate actions to be performed

### 4. Strategy Framework (`src/strategy/`)

Provides infrastructure for implementing and executing trading strategies.

Key components:

- `Strategy`: Base class for all trading strategies
- `MLStrategyClassifier`: Machine learning-based strategy classification
- Signal generators and entry/exit logic components

Design patterns:

- **Template Method**: Common strategy workflow with customizable hooks
- **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable strategy implementations

### 5. Risk Management (`src/risk/`)

Handles position sizing, risk assessment, and trading constraints.

Key components:

- `RiskManager`: Central risk management coordination
- Risk models for different risk metrics (VaR, drawdown, etc.)
- Position sizing algorithms

Design patterns:

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Risk checks are performed sequentially
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different risk models for different scenarios

### 6. Analytics (`src/analytics/`)

Provides performance analysis, reporting, and visualization.

Key components:

- `Analytics`: Base analytics framework
- `PerformanceForecaster`: Predictive analytics for strategy performance

Design patterns:

- **Visitor Pattern**: Analyze different components without modifying them
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct complex reports incrementally

### 7. Market Microstructure (`src/market_microstructure/`)

Provides advanced market models for more realistic backtesting.

Key components:

- Order book simulation
- Market impact models
- Latency and slippage simulation

### 8. UI Framework (`src/ui/`)

Handles visualization and user interface.

Key components:

- Interactive charts and dashboards
- Configuration interfaces
- Results visualization

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies rather than creating them
3. **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures where possible
4. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer object composition to class inheritance
5. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Resources are managed through object lifetimes

## Technology Stack

- **Core Language**: C++17
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Libraries**:
  - dlib: Machine learning and optimization
  - cpr: HTTP client for data retrieval
  - mio: Memory-mapped I/O for efficient data loading
  - zstd: Data compression

## Performance Considerations

- Critical paths are optimized for low latency
- Memory-mapped files for efficient data access
- Lock-free data structures for concurrent operations
- Careful memory management to avoid unnecessary allocations
- Vectorized calculations where applicable

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **New Data Sources**: Implement the DataSource interface
2. **New Strategies**: Inherit from the Strategy base class
3. **Custom Risk Models**: Extend the RiskModel base class
4. **Additional Analytics**: Implement the AnalyticsProvider interface

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Distributed backtesting for large-scale simulations
- GPU acceleration for machine learning components
- Cloud integration for data storage and processing
